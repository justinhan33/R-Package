# R Binomial Package
The purpose of this project is to create an R package that implements functions for
calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the
probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

The Binomial distribution is perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete
random variables. This is the theoretical probability model that we use when calculating
probabilities about the number of successes in a fixed number of random trials performed
under identical conditions (assuming a constant probability of success on each trial).

This package is ready to be submitted to CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).
